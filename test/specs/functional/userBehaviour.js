//4. Simulate user behavior
// (note: this is an opportunity for you to show some more advanced code but isnâ€™t a requirement to submit your project) -
// We want to simulate actual user behavior.
//We'd like you to create 3-5 rooms and between 5-10 users per test run.
// Each user should join a random room from the set you just created, note each person already in the chat room, and then send an individual "hello NAME" message to each active participant
